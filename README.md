# N400 ERP in Picture-Word Semantic Integration

This repository focuses on studying how the brain processes and integrates information, with a specific emphasis on the brain's response to two conditions (match and mismatch). The experiment involved participants viewing pictures of objects followed by spoken words, with predictions of the presence of an N400 ERP component for mismatched trials compared to matched ones. The N400 is a marker of brain processes related to semantic integration and detecting violations of meaning within a given context.

**Preprocessing**: Preprocessing steps are applied to EEG data to remove noise and obtain a clean signal of interest before analysis and interpretation. These steps are essential for effective neuroimaging data analysis, including EEG and MEG data.
